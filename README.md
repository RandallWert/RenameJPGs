# RenameJPGs
Repo for utility program for reading EXIF data and renaming JPG image files as YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.jpg

Cameras typically produce image files with sequential filenames. These sequential filenames are meaningless to anyone scrolling through a list of image files. My little utility program is designed to read the year, month, day, and time from the EXIF data in a jpg image file, then rename the image file in the format "YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.jpg". This helps users see at a glance when the image was created. It also aids in sorting images chronologically in a list.
